# Website-Using-JavaScript

This website is part of an assignment during my academic course. It involves using a single webpage and interacts with a json file using vanilla JavaScript to return queries by the user. The user can:
* Select the day and date for which scheduling information and it will be displayed on the page.
* Select a time slot fo which informatioin will be displayed.
* When the user selects a submit button the webpage will display:
  * The day selected, 
  * Information about the session chosen.
