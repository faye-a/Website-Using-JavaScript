        <h1>Welcome to CHI 2021</h1>
        <article class="welcome-letter">
            <p>Dear CHI 2020 community,</p>

            <p>We promised to give you an update on the possibility of a virtual CHI 2020 as a result of the decision not to hold CHI 2020 physically in Hawaiʻi.</p>

            <p>In extensive consultation with the SIGCHI Executive Committee and CHI Steering Committee, it was decided that it is best not to hold a virtual CHI 2020, given the uncertainty of current circumstances. We are extremely grateful for the offers from the community to help; however, our organizing-committee volunteers have already invested so much effort into CHI 2020, and many of them are already dealing with additional workloads as a consequence of Covid-19. CHI aims to be a first class event for both scientific and social interactions, and we believe it will not be possible to achieve the expected level of quality in a virtual conference given the limited time available between now and the conference dates.</p>

            <p>The Doctoral Consortium and Student Research Competition (but not the Student Game Competition due to the need for playability of their games) as “self-contained” tracks with a selected participant pool will self-organize in order to virtually convene and provide feedback to their student participants. The Student Research Competition will also determine winners, as originally planned.</p>  

            <p>Workshops organizers may self-organize virtual events if they wish to bring their groups together, as they already know their participants.</p>

            <p>SIGs, Panels, etc. may also self-organize virtual events, but again, we will not be able to provide any coordination or support from CHI 2020 for these events.</p> 

            <p>We would again like to thank everyone who has helped so much up to this point, and are sorry that this journey ends here. We especially like to thank the sponsors who generously donated their contributions to CHI 2020 to help offset cancellation costs, and inform you that the sponsor links on our recruiting page will remain live for those interested in making contact.</p> 

            <p>Again, we are very sorry that we cannot hold a physical or virtual CHI 2020, as we would have liked to “hang” with all of you, in some shape or form, but we hope to see you next year at CHI 2021 in Yokohama, Japan.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all your support during these challenging times.</p> 
            <p>Mahalo!</p>

            <p>Your General Chairs,</p>
            <p>Regina &amp; Floyd.</p>
